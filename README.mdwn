# Hugo Container

## Usage

```
docker run -it --rm        \
  --publish 1313:1313      \
  --volume $(pwd):/tmp/pwd \
  --user $(id -u)          \
  frew/hugo                \
  server
```

## Description

[Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) is a static site generator written in Go.  It is
incredibly fast and efficient.  Normally a container for a typical Go program
would be overkill, as the binaries are statically linked.  In Hugo's case,
though, Python is used to syntax highlight code, along with a few libraries to
support that feature.  This container includes everything to support the syntax
highlighting.

## Ports

Port `1313` is exposed for the debug server.

## Volumes

The one exposed / required volume is `/tmp/pwd`, which represents the directory
you want to be Hugo's pwd.

## Shortcut Usage

I recommend putting the following script in your path to make usage of this
container easier, presumably named `hugo`:

```
#!/bin/dash

exec docker run -it --rm   \
  --publish 1313:1313      \
  --volume $(pwd):/tmp/pwd \
  --user $(id -u)          \
  frew/hugo                \
  "$@"
```

Note that because the above publishes to a static port you cannot, for instance,
run `hugo help` while `hugo server` is already running.  I warmly welcome
patches to only add the `--publish 1313:1313` if `server` is the subcommand
being used.
